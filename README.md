In your README.md, add a section like:

## API Keys

This project requires an OpenAI API key.  
**Do not share your API key publicly.**  
Set your key as an environment variable before running the app:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

---

### **5. Remove Any Existing Keys from Git History**

If you ever committed your API key by mistake, let me know and I’ll show you how to remove it from your git history.

---

**Let me know if you want a sample `.gitignore` or help updating your README!**  
You’re doing everything right to keep your project secure and professional.
